<h2>Analysis of Personality and Social Behaviour</h2>
<p>The main objective is to classify general public of different age groups.</p>
<h4> Methods used: </h4>
<p>1. Elbow method<br>
2. K-means clustering<br>
3. Hierarchical clustering<br>
4. Principal Component Analysis<br></p>
<h4>Outcome:</h4>
<p>• From the plot of the elbow method, we could observe that the line is bent at the 
range 5 making it the optimal number of clusters for the dataset.<br>
• By using k means clustering the clusters have been formed.<br>
• By using PCA we found that the variables whose value is greater than 0.5 has a 
great influence on once personality and social behaviour.<br>
• The within-cluster sum of squares is a measure of the variability of the observations 
within each cluster. In general, a cluster that has a small sum of squares is more 
compact than a cluster that has a large sum of squares. Clusters that have higher 
values exhibit greater variability of the observations within the cluster.<br>
• In Silhouhette method<br>
• Observations with a large silhouhette Si (almost 1) are very well clustered.<br>
• A small Si (around 0) means that the observation lies between two clusters.<br>
• Observations with a negative Si are probably placed in the wrong cluster.<br>
• For the age category 13-18 it observed that people under this category are 
extroverts and intuitive. They can cope with emotions and are well planned. They 
are assertive.<br>
• The people under age category 19-24 have similar personality and behavioural 
pattern of people below 19.<br>
• People of age between 25-30 are extroverts and strongly intuitive people. Their 
capacity to cope with emotions are high. They are very well planned and assertive 
people.<br>
• 31-59 highly extroverted and highly intuitive, can easily manage their emotions 
and are planned.<br>
• Within sum of squares less, the cluster is more compact.<br>
• Within sum of squares of MIND is the greatest, hence making it the most dissimilar 
cluster.<br>
